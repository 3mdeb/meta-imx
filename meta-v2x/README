i.MX Linux Yocto BSP layer for V2X support
==========================================

This layer provides support for i.MX-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
Communications, leveraging the internal HSM implementation in SECO / V2X IPs.

This layer applies to i.MX 8DXL parts only.

To use the layer add the following line to $BUILDDIR/conf/bblayers.conf:

BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-imx/meta-v2x"

The layer depends on:
